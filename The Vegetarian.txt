This will be a review on the Bestseller Fiction novel the Vegetarian by Han Kang

A very disturbing and perturbing account surrounding 4 people and the book consists of only 3 chapters, averaging about 50 to 60 pages per chapter, the book is written from the perspective of 3 characters whose lives have been severely affected by a dream and subsequent actions of Yeong-hye, the wife of the narrator, Mr. Cheong, in the first chapter, sister-in-law of the person mentioned in the second chapter and the sister of Ing-hye around whom the third chapter revolves around. The complicated nature and psychological impact Yeong-hye's life has had on her, the choices pushed on to her and the several pertubations she experienced while being in her own home and even when she was married off to Mr Cheong, shape this woman's fragile psyche to the extreme where reality itself is marred and she can no longer consider herself as human to the extent where she "atones" for her existence by constricting herself to a strictly vegetarian diet, something she was never familiar with, which leads her to develop a sever eating disorder that gets worse accompanied by the severe schizophrenia she experiences from the dreams she keeps having. The book revolves around her life from the unique perspectives of her husband, Mr Cheong, who sees her as merely a tool to satisfy him and wishes her to be content to just be serving him, on an additional note a thought that is shared by his father in law, Yeong-hye's own father.
