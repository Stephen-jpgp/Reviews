This will be a review on the Bestseller Fiction novel the Vegetarian by Han Kang

A very disturbing and perturbing account surrounding 4 people and the book consists of only 3 chapters, averaging about 50 to 60 pages per chapter, the book is written from the perspective of 3 characters whose lives have been severely affected by a dream and subsequent actions of Yeong-hye, the wife of the narrator, Mr. Cheong, in the first chapter, sister-in-law of the person mentioned in the second chapter and the sister of Ing-hye around whom the third chapter revolves around. The complicated nature and psychological impact Yeong-hye's life has had on her, the choices pushed on to her and the several pertubations she experienced while being in her own home and even when she was married off to Mr Cheong, shape this woman's fragile psyche to the extreme where reality itself is marred and she can no longer consider herself as human to the extent where she "atones" for her existence by constricting herself to a strictly vegetarian diet, something she was never familiar with, which leads her to develop a sever eating disorder that gets worse accompanied by the severe schizophrenia she experiences from the dreams she keeps having. The book revolves around her life from the unique perspectives of her husband, Mr Cheong, who sees her as merely a tool to satisfy him and wishes her to be content to just be serving him, on an additional note a thought that is shared by his father in law, Yeong-hye's own father. When he realised his wife would never return back to the life he was accustomed to, he served her with divorce papers, ending all contact with her and her family and disappearing entirely from every aspect of her life. 
The second chapter trails off from the first when Yeong-hye tries to slit her hands when she was forced fed meet by her father after he strikes her for disobeying his command to consume whatever was made on the table. This chapter presents the perspective of Yeong-hye's brother in law, Ing-hye's husband, a man so consumed by art, his mind raced with lewd and lustful intentions towards Yeong-hye when his wife mentioned that Yeong-hye still had her Mongolian mark from childhood. This prompts him to imagine a scenario where she would have intercourse with another man all decorated in flowers and petals, surrounding her Mongolian mark. Yeong-hye is now being treated for her condition and he provides Yeong-hye the opportunity to perform for him where he would capture him painting on her body using his camcorder. Initially he convinces his coworker,a man with a better physique than him, to have intercourse with her but he refuses, alarmed by the absurdness and absolute lack of decency
